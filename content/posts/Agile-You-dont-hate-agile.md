Cheeky bait title aside, in my opinion most probably what you actually hate isn't even Agile but some waterfall/extreme programming Frankenstein's monster stuck together with duct tape, sticks and misery which managers (controlling freaks) named Agile.

## The premise

of Agile is simple:
- Self-governing teams
- Self-organizing teams
- Stay in contact with the customer as often as *possible*
- Iterate as often as *possible*
- Deliver as often as *possible*
- Simplicity over complexity
- Introduce change to the process and product as *needed*

Notice how the accent is on doing everything as often or as much as *possible* and as *needed*. No fixed timescales, no sprints, no fixed iterations, no fixed anything. It's all about adjusting the process according to the possibilities and needs of the team to create a good product. This is all a bunch of common sense, right? So where in the world did all the sprints, reviews, retrospectives, planning meetings, stand-ups, and all the other nonsense come from?
