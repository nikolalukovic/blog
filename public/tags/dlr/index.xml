      <description>Reflection API in .NET is one of the most powerful and incredible features of it. And along with DLR it enables a whole new look at what can be done in .NET languages.&#xA;One of problems i had to solve recently was how to create a unified DSL for queries that could be used with most C# DB drivers(they had to have IQueryable support).&#xA;It turned out to be simpler job than i thought.</description>
